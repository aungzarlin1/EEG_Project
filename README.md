-- 'data' Folder contains '_epo.fif' files

### Data Pipeline

We loaded all data from .csv files and turned into "_epo.fif" formats. Each coding process includes in "Load_data.ipynb" file. The following preprocessing steps are done.
    
    1. Load csv
    2. Convert to raw - set montage, eeg channels, targets and sampling frequency
    3. Filter - electrical band, -0.1 to 0.7 band pass
    4. Epoching - epoch "Target" and "Non-target"
    5. save - as "_epo.fif" format
    
"Load_data_pool.ipynb" loads all the "_epo.fif" files and convert each and every of them into numpy arrays and concatenate each others into X and y. The sample shape becomes (34236, 32, 410) for BN3 Conv1D or (34236, 1, 32, 410) for CNN Conv2D.
    
### Models

We used total of 3 models named BN3 (Batchnormalization Conv1D), BN3+LSTM and CNN Conv2D.

### Experiment

The experiment includes the following.

    1. Trained and test on one subject and test on another subject.
         - Classical machine learning models: SVM and LDA as baselines
         - BN3, BN3+LSTM, CNN Conv2D
    2. Subject specific
         - BN3, BN3+LSTM, CNN Conv2D
    3. Regional channel
         - BN3, BN3+LSTM, CNN Conv2D
    4. Subject Pool
         - BN3, BN3+LSTM, CNN Conv2D
         
## 15- 21 November

- Data are saved as (.fif) file in folder in order to save time when we want to run the data in model again.
- Build CNN model and recorded the accuracy in excels for both 1 subject and each channels of that subject.
- Compared accuracy result with ML models.


Expected to finish next week
- Improve CNN model as possible as to beat the accuracy of ML
- Build LSTM+CNN model

## 8- 14 November

modeling - 80 %
In this week, we do P300 analysis and continue working on classification models.

Expected to do next week
-inter-brain synchrony


## 1- 7 November

modeling - 50 %
In this week, we fit the data with 4 models (ML, LSTM, CNN with 1d and 2d) and compare the accuracy.

Expecting to work on the next week
- p300 Analysis

## 25 - 31 Ocotober

preprocessing and modeling - 25%

We have done in this week.
- ICA (difficult to differentiate bettween eye,muscle artifacts and signals)
- Epoching

Expecting to work on the next week
- modeling

## 18 - 24 October

We done this steps in data processing:
  - transform data in to raw mne object
  - notch filter 
  - band pass filter
      
## Expected to finish in next week

  - got error in notch filter coding and try to fix
  - ICA
  - epoching
