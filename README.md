## 15- 21 November
- Data are saved as numpy file in folder in order to save time when we want to run the data in model again.
- Build CNN model and recorded the accuracy in excels for both 1 subject and each channels of that subject.
- Compared accuracy result with ML models.


Expected to finish next week
- Improve CNN model as possible as to beat the accuracy of ML
- Build LSTM+CNN model

## 8- 14 November

modeling - 80 %

In this week, we do P300 analysis and continue working on classification models.

Expected to do next week
-inter-brain synchrony


## 1- 7 November

modeling - 50 %

In this week, we fit the data with 4 models (ML, LSTM, CNN with 1d and 2d) and compare the accuracy.

Expecting to work on the next week
- p300 Analysis

## 25 - 31 Ocotober

preprocessing and modeling - 25%

We have done in this week.
- ICA (difficult to differentiate bettween eye,muscle artifacts and signals)
- Epoching

Expecting to work on the next week
- modeling
## 18 - 24 October
modeling - 7%

loading the dataset - 100%

creating the github - 100%

reading paper - 90 % 

we read the following paper

We done this steps in data processing:
  - transform data in to raw mne object
  - notch filter 
  - band pass filter
      
# Expected to finish in next week
  - got error in notch filter coding and try to fix
  - ICA
  - epoching
## 11 - 17 October
